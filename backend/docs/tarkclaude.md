# DIMENSION 1: OWNERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY

## 1.1 Description

Ownership & Accountability measures a candidate's tendency to take personal responsibility for outcomes, proactively drive initiatives to completion, and accept consequences of decisions without deflecting blame. This dimension is critical in modern engineering hiring because distributed teams and asynchronous work require individuals who operate autonomously and reliably without constant supervision. Failing this dimension typically manifests as chronic excuse-making, finger-pointing toward teammates or external factors, and a pattern of abandoned or incomplete initiatives.

## 1.2 Positive Signals

- Candidate uses "I" language when describing failures and "we" language when describing successes
- Provides specific examples of staying with a problem until resolution, even outside normal scope
- Demonstrates awareness of downstream impact of their decisions on other teams or customers
- Mentions proactively flagging risks or blockers before they escalate
- Describes situations where they voluntarily took on unassigned but necessary work
- Shows evidence of following up on delegated tasks to ensure completion
- Articulates lessons learned from failures without prompting
- References personal metrics or KPIs they track to measure their own effectiveness
- Describes instances of reversing their own decision when evidence warranted it
- Mentions holding themselves to deadlines even when external pressure was absent

## 1.3 Negative Signals

- Consistently attributes project failures to external circumstances or other people
- Uses passive voice when describing negative outcomes ("mistakes were made")
- Cannot articulate what they would do differently in hindsight
- Describes dropping tasks when they became difficult or ambiguous
- Shows pattern of waiting for explicit instructions before acting
- Mentions escalating problems without first attempting resolution
- Provides vague descriptions of their specific contribution in team settings
- Demonstrates confusion about the boundaries of their responsibility
- References "not my job" thinking when discussing adjacent tasks
- Cannot name a single professional failure or mistake

## 1.4 Red Flags

- Blames a former manager or teammate for a significant failure without any self-reflection
- Describes leaving a role specifically because they were held accountable for a negative outcome
- Cannot provide any example of taking ownership when not explicitly required
- Shows pattern of project abandonment across multiple roles
- Demonstrates victim mentality when discussing career setbacks

## 1.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about a time when a project you were responsible for failed or significantly underperformed. What happened, and what did you do?

**Question 2:** Describe a situation where you identified a problem outside your direct responsibilities. How did you handle it?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of a commitment you made to a teammate or stakeholder that became very difficult to keep. What did you do?

## 1.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** You mentioned [external factor]. If we removed that factor entirely, what role did your own decisions play in the outcome?

**Follow-Up 2:** Looking back with full hindsight, what is the earliest point at which you could have changed the trajectory of that situation? Why didn't you act then?

**Follow-Up 3:** If your manager at the time were here right now, how would they describe your level of ownership in that situation? Would they agree with your assessment?

## 1.7 Sample Good Answer

"In my previous role, I led the migration of our authentication service to a new provider. Three weeks before launch, I discovered that our token refresh logic had an edge case that would lock out users with expired sessions. This was technically within my scope, but the root cause was a miscommunication I had with the identity team earlier. I immediately owned the situation: I documented the issue, proposed two solutions with tradeoffs, and presented them to my manager the same day. We chose to delay launch by one week. I then scheduled a retro where I specifically called out my own failure to verify assumptions during the design phase. I created a checklist for future integrations that our team still uses. The experience taught me to validate integration contracts earlier, even when I trust the other team."

## 1.8 Sample Bad Answer

"We had this project that didn't go well, but honestly, the requirements kept changing and the PM wasn't really clear about what they wanted. I did my part, but other teams were slow to respond, and by the time we got their APIs, the deadline had passed. Management didn't really give us enough resources either. I think I did what I could given the circumstances. It's hard to succeed when you're set up to fail. I moved on to the next project after that, and things went better because we had a better PM."

# DIMENSION 2: STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION

## 2.1 Description

Structured Communication measures a candidate's ability to organize information logically, convey complex ideas with appropriate detail, and adapt their message to different audiences and contexts. This dimension is essential in engineering hiring because engineers must translate technical complexity into actionable information for diverse stakeholders, write clear documentation, and participate effectively in design discussions. Failing this dimension typically appears as rambling responses, inability to summarize key points, or mismatch between communication style and audience needs.

## 2.2 Positive Signals

- Opens responses with a clear summary or thesis before providing details
- Uses frameworks or mental models to organize information (e.g., "There are three factors...")
- Adjusts technical depth based on the interviewer's role and questions
- Provides concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Signals transitions between topics explicitly
- Pauses to check understanding during complex explanations
- Distinguishes between facts, assumptions, and opinions
- Uses analogies effectively to bridge knowledge gaps
- Provides appropriate context before diving into specifics

- Struggles to summarize their own response when asked
- Conflates technical accuracy with communication effectiveness
- Cannot adjust explanation level when asked to simplify
- Leaves implicit connections that require interviewer inference
- Repeats information without adding new insight
- Ends responses without clear conclusion or resolution

## 2.4 Red Flags

- Cannot explain their own work in simple terms after multiple attempts
- Becomes defensive or dismissive when asked to clarify
- Shows pattern of miscommunication leading to project failures
- Refuses to adapt communication style, insisting their approach is correct
- Demonstrates contempt for non-technical audiences

## 2.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Explain a complex technical concept from your recent work as if you were presenting it to a non-technical product manager who needs to make a prioritization decision.

**Question 2:** Walk me through how you would structure a document or presentation explaining a major architectural decision to a mixed audience of engineers and business stakeholders.

**Question 3:** Tell me about a time when miscommunication caused a problem on your team. What happened and how was it resolved?

## 2.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** That explanation had several components. If you had only 30 seconds to convey the most critical point, what would you say?

**Follow-Up 2:** You mentioned [technical term]. If someone in this meeting didn't know that term, how would you explain it without using any other technical vocabulary?

**Follow-Up 3:** What signals do you look for to determine whether your audience has understood your explanation? How do you adjust when they haven't?

## 2.7 Sample Good Answer

"When I needed to explain our service mesh migration to the VP of Product, I structured the conversation around her primary concern: customer-facing reliability. I opened with the key message—that this change would reduce outage frequency by approximately 40% based on similar migrations. Then I explained the 'what' at a conceptual level: we were adding an intelligent traffic layer that could automatically route around failures. I used an analogy of GPS rerouting traffic during road construction. I saved the technical details about sidecar proxies and mTLS for a follow-up document for her technical advisor. At the end, I asked if there were specific customer scenarios she wanted me to map to the new architecture. She later told me it was the clearest infrastructure explanation she'd received."

## 2.8 Sample Bad Answer

"So we needed to migrate to a service mesh because our current setup wasn't handling the traffic well. A service mesh is basically when you have sidecars injected into your pods—do you know what Kubernetes is? Anyway, the sidecars handle the networking so your application doesn't have to. We use Istio, which is the most popular one. There's also Linkerd but we didn't choose that. The migration took about three months and we had to update all our Helm charts. The main thing was getting the mTLS working correctly because some services had issues with certificate rotation. It was pretty complex overall."

# DIMENSION 3: COLLABORATION & STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT

## 3.1 Description

Collaboration & Stakeholder Management measures a candidate's effectiveness in working with diverse individuals, navigating competing interests, building productive relationships, and achieving outcomes through influence rather than authority. This dimension is critical in modern engineering because cross-functional work is now standard, and engineers must coordinate with product managers, designers, other engineering teams, and external partners. Failing this dimension typically manifests as isolated work patterns, adversarial relationships with other teams, inability to resolve conflicts constructively, or projects stalling due to stakeholder misalignment.

## 3.2 Positive Signals

- Describes proactively reaching out to stakeholders before starting work
- Provides examples of understanding and balancing competing priorities
- Mentions building relationships before needing them transactionally
- Shows awareness of stakeholder incentives and constraints
- Describes adapting their approach based on stakeholder preferences
- Gives examples of turning adversarial relationships into productive ones
- Mentions creating shared visibility through documentation or regular updates
- Describes involving stakeholders in problem-solving rather than just presenting solutions
- Shows pattern of receiving positive feedback from cross-functional partners
- Demonstrates patience with organizational complexity

## 3.3 Negative Signals

- Describes stakeholders primarily as obstacles or sources of unreasonable demands
- Shows pattern of going around stakeholders rather than engaging them
- Cannot name specific strategies for working with difficult personalities
- Describes collaboration as one-directional information transfer
- Shows no awareness of other teams' constraints or priorities
- Avoids conflict by withdrawing rather than engaging
- Cannot provide examples of influencing without authority
- Describes surprise at stakeholder reactions that were predictable
- Mentions waiting for stakeholders to come to them rather than proactive outreach
- Shows pattern of projects stalled due to coordination failures

## 3.4 Red Flags

- Describes consistent pattern of conflict with stakeholders across multiple roles
- Shows contempt for non-engineering functions (product, design, sales, etc.)
- Cannot describe any successful stakeholder relationship
- Blames failed collaboration entirely on other parties in multiple instances
- Demonstrates manipulation tactics as primary influence strategy

## 3.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about a time when you had to work with a stakeholder who had very different priorities or incentives than you. How did you navigate that relationship?

**Question 2:** Describe a situation where you needed to influence a decision but had no direct authority over the outcome. What was your approach?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of a cross-functional project that faced significant coordination challenges. What was your role in addressing them?

## 3.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** You described what you did. From the stakeholder's perspective, how do you think they experienced working with you? What evidence do you have for that?

**Follow-Up 2:** In that conflict, what was one thing the other party was right about that you initially didn't see? How did recognizing that change your approach?

**Follow-Up 3:** If that same stakeholder situation happened again tomorrow, what would you do differently in the first week, knowing what you know now?

## 3.7 Sample Good Answer

"In my last role, I needed to work with our security team to implement a new authentication flow. Initially, there was tension—they saw our team as trying to rush through reviews, and we saw them as blockers. I asked to join one of their team syncs to understand their review queue and priorities. I learned they were measured on finding vulnerabilities, not on review speed, and they were understaffed. I proposed a lightweight pre-review process: our team would complete a security self-assessment using their checklist before formal submission. This reduced their review burden by about 30%, and our review times dropped from two weeks to four days. The security lead later invited me to help them design the self-assessment template for other teams. The key was understanding their constraints before proposing solutions."

## 3.8 Sample Bad Answer

"We had this security team that was always blocking our releases. Every time we needed a review, it would take forever. I tried explaining that our deadlines were tight, but they didn't care. Eventually, I started scheduling our submissions earlier to account for their delays, which kind of worked but was frustrating. My manager had to escalate a few times to get things moving. I think they just didn't understand how engineering works under deadlines. It would have been better if they had more resources or different priorities, but that wasn't something I could control."

# DIMENSION 4: PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH

## 4.1 Description

Problem-Solving Approach measures a candidate's methodology for diagnosing issues, generating solutions, evaluating tradeoffs, and making decisions under uncertainty. This dimension is vital in engineering hiring because engineers constantly face ambiguous problems where the correct path is not immediately clear and where poor decisions have lasting technical and business consequences. Failing this dimension typically appears as pattern-matching without analysis, inability to structure ambiguous problems, jumping to solutions before understanding constraints, or paralysis when faced with incomplete information.

## 4.2 Positive Signals

- Describes gathering information and validating assumptions before solutioning

- Describes involving appropriate experts when encountering knowledge gaps
- Shows awareness of second-order effects and long-term consequences
- Mentions documenting decisions and reasoning for future reference
- Demonstrates appropriate scoping—neither too narrow nor too expansive
- Shows evidence of learning from failed approaches

## 4.3 Negative Signals

- Jumps directly to solutions without exploring problem space
- Describes single approach without considering alternatives
- Cannot articulate tradeoffs in decisions they made
- Shows discomfort with ambiguity; seeks premature closure
- Relies entirely on past patterns without validating applicability
- Cannot explain how they would know if their solution was wrong
- Describes decisions made without understanding constraints
- Shows pattern of fixing symptoms rather than root causes
- Cannot adapt approach when initial solution fails
- Demonstrates analysis paralysis—cannot decide with incomplete information

## 4.4 Red Flags

- Claims to have never been wrong about a significant decision
- Shows pattern of catastrophic failures due to unexamined assumptions
- Describes copying solutions without understanding underlying logic
- Cannot describe any systematic approach to problem-solving
- Demonstrates arrogance about problem-solving ability without supporting evidence

## 4.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about a complex technical problem you faced where the right approach was not immediately obvious. Walk me through how you worked through it.

**Question 2:** Describe a decision you made with incomplete information. How did you decide, and how did you manage the risk of being wrong?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of a time when your initial approach to a problem turned out to be wrong. How did you discover this and what did you do?

## 4.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** You mentioned you chose [approach]. What was the strongest argument against that choice, and how did you weigh it?

**Follow-Up 2:** At what point in that process would you have known if you were heading in the wrong direction? What signals were you watching for?

**Follow-Up 3:** If you had twice the time and resources, how would your approach have been different? If you had half, what would you have cut?

## 4.7 Sample Good Answer

"We faced intermittent latency spikes in our payment processing service that were impacting checkout success rates. Rather than immediately adding capacity, I first defined the problem precisely: spikes were occurring about 2% of the time, lasting 30–60 seconds, affecting specific merchant categories. I hypothesized three potential causes: database connection pool exhaustion, third-party API degradation, or garbage collection pauses. I added targeted instrumentation for each hypothesis and let it run for 48 hours. The data showed connection pool exhaustion was primary, triggered when certain merchants had seasonal traffic surges. I proposed two solutions: dynamic pool sizing versus a queuing system. We chose dynamic sizing because it had lower complexity and our SLA could tolerate the brief increase in latency during scaling. I documented the decision and set up alerts for the other hypotheses in case they emerged later."

## 4.8 Sample Bad Answer

"We had latency problems, so I looked at what we did last time, which was increasing the server instances. That helped a bit but the problem came back. Then I tried optimizing some database queries that seemed slow. That also helped a little. We kept doing different things until eventually it got better. I think it might have been related to traffic patterns or something. We never really figured out the exact cause, but the fixes we made improved things overall. Now when we have latency issues, we just scale up first and see if that helps."

# DIMENSION 5: LEARNING AGILITY

## 5.1 Description

Learning Agility measures a candidate's capacity and willingness to acquire new skills, adapt to changing contexts, seek feedback, and apply lessons from experience effectively. This dimension is essential in modern engineering because technology and practices evolve rapidly, and engineers must continuously update their skills while learning domain-specific knowledge in new roles. Failing this dimension typically manifests as stagnation in outdated practices, resistance to new approaches, inability to ramp up in new areas, or repeated mistakes despite experience.

## 5.2 Positive Signals

- Shows defensive hostility toward feedback
- Cannot name anything learned in past two years
- Demonstrates that past failures haven't changed any behavior
- Blames learning challenges entirely on inadequate training or support

## 5.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about a time when you had to learn something significantly new for your work. How did you approach it, and how did you know when you'd learned enough?

**Question 2:** Describe the most useful piece of critical feedback you've received in your career. How did you receive it, and what did you do with it?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of something you believed or practiced that you later changed your mind about based on new information or experience. What prompted the change?

## 5.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** You mentioned learning [skill/domain]. What was the hardest part of that learning process, and how did you push through it?

**Follow-Up 2:** When you received that feedback, what was your initial internal reaction? How did you move from that reaction to actually changing your behavior?

**Follow-Up 3:** How would someone who worked with you two years ago describe your approach compared to today? What specific differences would they notice?

## 5.7 Sample Good Answer

"When I transitioned from backend to our machine learning team, I had minimal ML experience. I started by assessing what I actually needed to learn versus what was nice-to-have—I needed practical implementation skills, not research-level theory. I found a mentor on the team and asked for their recommended resources, then set aside four hours weekly for structured learning. I also volunteered for the simplest ML tasks to get hands-on experience, explicitly telling reviewers I wanted detailed feedback. The hardest part was accepting that my code reviews would have many comments after being senior in my previous domain. After three months, I was contributing to production models. I learned that my backend experience actually added value—I improved our model serving infrastructure because I could bridge both worlds. Now I apply this same structured approach whenever I face new domains."

## 5.8 Sample Bad Answer

"I try to keep up with things, you know, reading articles and stuff. In terms of feedback, I don't really get much—I guess that means I'm doing okay. I've been doing basically the same kind of work for a while now, so there hasn't been much need to learn totally new things. When I need to learn something, I usually just Google it or ask someone. I haven't really changed my approach much because what I do works. If the company wanted me to learn new things, they'd provide training. I'm pretty good at picking things up when I need to."

# DIMENSION 6: LEADERSHIP SIGNALS

## 6.1 Description

Leadership Signals measures a candidate's potential and demonstrated ability to influence direction, elevate team performance, make decisions in ambiguous situations, and take initiative beyond individual contribution. This dimension is important in engineering hiring because even individual contributors must demonstrate technical leadership, and high-performers often grow into formal leadership roles. Failing this dimension typically manifests as waiting for direction rather than setting it, inability to influence team decisions, reluctance to take stands on important issues, or purely individual contribution without team impact.

## 6.2 Positive Signals

## 6.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about a time when you drove an important initiative or decision without having formal authority to do so. What happened?

**Question 2:** Describe a situation where you helped a teammate improve their performance or work through a challenge. What was your approach?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of a time when you had to take a stand on a technical or strategic matter where others disagreed. How did you handle it?

## 6.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** In that initiative, how did you get others to follow your direction when you couldn't simply assign them? What would have happened if they had refused?

**Follow-Up 2:** You mentioned helping [teammate]. How did you balance being helpful with respecting their autonomy? How do you know your help actually helped versus enabling dependence?

**Follow-Up 3:** When you took that stand, what specifically changed your mind about pushing versus accepting the group consensus? How do you calibrate when to push harder?

## 6.7 Sample Good Answer

"Our codebase had growing technical debt in our authentication module that was causing recurring bugs and slowing development. It wasn't prioritized because each individual bug seemed small. I decided to make the case for a focused cleanup sprint. I first documented the cumulative cost: I tracked time spent on auth-related bugs and slow development over three months, totaling about 15% of team capacity. I created a proposal showing the investment-to-payoff ratio and risks of not acting. When I presented it to the team, two senior engineers disagreed about priority. Instead of retreating, I acknowledged their concerns, incorporated their constraint about not disrupting the upcoming release, and proposed a phased approach. The team approved a two-week focused sprint after the release. I led the sprint, including pairing with junior developers to increase bus factor. We reduced auth-related incidents by 80% over the next quarter, and the pattern of quantifying tech debt cost became a team standard."

## 6.8 Sample Bad Answer

"I try to lead by example and do good work. If people want to follow how I do things, they can. I haven't really had official leadership opportunities yet—I've been waiting for a promotion to Tech Lead. I give feedback sometimes in code reviews. I'm not really the type to push my ideas on others; I figure if my idea is good, people will eventually recognize it. I'd like to be a leader someday, but I think you need the formal role first to really do it. My manager is good at leading, so I usually let them handle the team direction stuff."

# DIMENSION 7: RESILIENCE & STRESS HANDLING

## 7.1 Description

Resilience & Stress Handling measures a candidate's ability to maintain effectiveness under pressure, recover from setbacks, manage emotional responses to challenging situations, and sustain performance during extended difficulty. This dimension is critical in engineering hiring because engineering inherently involves deadlines, production incidents, difficult tradeoffs, and failures, requiring individuals who can function well under pressure without burning out or creating negative team dynamics. Failing this dimension typically manifests as degraded performance under pressure, difficulty recovering from criticism or failure, creating stress for others during difficult periods, or avoidance of challenging situations.

## 7.2 Positive Signals

- Describes maintaining performance during high-pressure situations
- Shows evidence of learning and growing from setbacks
- Mentions specific strategies for managing stress effectively
- Demonstrates appropriate prioritization when under pressure
- Shows ability to separate personal worth from work outcomes
- Mentions supporting teammates during stressful periods
- Describes recovering from failures without extended negative impact
- Shows awareness of own stress signals and proactive management
- Demonstrates sustainable work patterns rather than chronic overextension
- Mentions maintaining perspective during crises

## 7.3 Negative Signals

- Describes performance significantly degrading under pressure
- Shows evidence of extended recovery periods after setbacks
- Mentions transferring stress to teammates through behavior
- Describes avoidance of high-pressure situations
- Shows pattern of burnout across multiple roles
- Cannot describe any effective stress management strategies
- Demonstrates catastrophizing about manageable difficulties
- Mentions conflict or relationship damage during stressful periods
- Shows pattern of making poor decisions under pressure
- Describes difficulty receiving criticism without extended impact

## 7.4 Red Flags

- Describes multiple breakdowns under normal work pressure
- Shows pattern of leaving roles due to stress without developing coping
- Cannot describe any recovery from any significant setback
- Demonstrates that stress consistently damages relationships or work quality
- Describes coping mechanisms that would be harmful in workplace

## 7.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Tell me about the most stressful project or period you've experienced in your career. How did you manage through it, and what was the outcome?

**Question 2:** Describe a significant professional setback or failure. How did you respond in the moment, and how did you recover?

**Question 3:** Give me an example of a time when you had to deliver results with unrealistic constraints or pressure. What tradeoffs did you make?

## 7.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** During that stressful period, how did your behavior toward teammates change? What feedback did you receive about how you showed up?

**Follow-Up 2:** You mentioned recovering from that setback. What specifically was the hardest part of the recovery, and how long did it take before you felt fully back to normal?

**Follow-Up 3:** If you faced a similar situation tomorrow, what would you do differently to manage your own stress response? What have you learned about your patterns?

## 7.7 Sample Good Answer

"Our team faced a critical production incident during our busiest season—our primary database had corruption affecting 10% of customer records. The initial pressure was intense: executives wanted hourly updates, customers were calling, and we didn't immediately know the scope. I took three specific steps to manage. First, I established a structured incident response: I volunteered for the communication role, which played to my strength and freed our most technical person to focus on the fix. Second, I set explicit work shifts to prevent burnout—we needed sustained effort, not heroics. Third, I maintained perspective: I reminded myself and the team that while urgent, this was solvable and wouldn't define our careers. The incident took 72 hours to resolve fully. Afterward, I took a day off and wrote up both the technical post-mortem and a personal reflection on what I'd do differently. The main learning was that I was underslept before the incident, which reduced my initial clarity. Now I'm more careful about my baseline condition during high-stakes periods."

## 7.8 Sample Bad Answer

"Stressful situations are tough. I remember this one project where everything was going wrong, and I was working super late every night. I got pretty burnt out by the end. I think I was short with some people, but everyone was stressed. It took me a few weeks to recover after that project ended. I try to avoid those situations now by being clearer about my bandwidth. Setbacks are hard—I tend to take them personally, but I'm working on that. I think I'm pretty resilient, though. I've always pushed through when I needed to, even if it wasn't pretty."

# DIMENSION 8: TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION

## 8.1 Description

Technical Communication measures a candidate's ability to convey technical concepts accurately and appropriately, participate effectively in technical discussions, create clear documentation, and bridge between technical implementation and business context. This dimension is essential in engineering hiring because engineers must communicate about technical work constantly—in design reviews, documentation, incident response, cross-team collaboration, and stakeholder updates. Failing this dimension typically manifests as unclear technical explanations, documentation that others can't use, inability to participate effectively in technical debates, or disconnect between technical and business framing.

## 8.2 Positive Signals

- Explains technical concepts with appropriate precision for the audience
- Creates documentation that enables others to act without follow-up questions
- Participates constructively in technical debates without becoming adversarial
- Connects technical decisions to business outcomes naturally
- Uses diagrams, examples, or analogies effectively to aid understanding
- Asks clarifying questions before making assumptions about technical context
- Provides appropriate caveats and limitations in technical assessments
- Adapts technical depth based on audience feedback
- Structures technical explanations logically with clear progression
- Acknowledges uncertainty appropriately rather than overstating confidence

## 8.3 Negative Signals

- Uses excessive jargon without explanation or necessity
- Cannot explain technical decisions in business terms
- Creates documentation that requires author interpretation to use
- Becomes defensive or dismissive in technical disagreements
- Provides explanations that are technically accurate but practically useless
- Cannot adjust explanation complexity for different audiences
- Makes confident technical claims without appropriate qualification
- Struggles to structure complex technical information coherently
- Cannot distinguish between essential and incidental technical details
- Uses imprecise language that creates ambiguity about technical matters

## 8.4 Red Flags

- Cannot explain any technical work without excessive jargon
- Documentation has caused significant project problems
- Shows pattern of technical miscommunication causing failures
- Demonstrates contempt for those with less technical depth
- Cannot participate in technical discussions without conflict

## 8.5 Core Interview Questions

**Question 1:** Walk me through a significant technical decision you made recently. Explain it as if you were presenting to a senior engineering leader who is technical but unfamiliar with your system.

**Question 2:** Tell me about a technical document or design you wrote that others used. How did you approach making it useful for its intended audience?

**Question 3:** Describe a technical disagreement you had with a colleague. How did the discussion progress, and how was it resolved?

## 8.6 Deep-Dive Follow-Up Questions

**Follow-Up 1:** You used the term [technical term]. If I were a product manager in this meeting, what would I need to understand about that term to participate in this decision?

**Follow-Up 2:** For that documentation you mentioned—how would you know if it was actually useful? Did you get feedback, and if so, what did you change?

**Follow-Up 3:** In that technical disagreement, what was the strongest version of the other person's argument? At what point might they have been right, and you wrong?

## 8.7 Sample Good Answer

"I led the design for migrating our monolith to microservices for our order management domain. When presenting to our VP of Engineering, I structured it in three parts: why (business drivers), what (architectural changes), and how (migration approach with risks). For the 'why,' I focused on the business metrics: our current architecture limited us to four releases per month, while competitors shipped daily. This framed the technical change in terms she cared about. For the 'what,' I used a before-and-after diagram showing how splitting order creation, fulfillment, and notification into separate services would allow independent deployment. I avoided implementation details like message queue choices—those were in the appendix for engineers who would review later. For 'how,' I presented our strangler fig pattern approach with clear checkpoints where we could evaluate progress. She asked about risk, so I had prepared a rollback plan and explained how we'd maintain dual operation during transition. The document was later used to onboard two new teams, so I know it worked because they could implement without extensive questions."

## 8.8 Sample Bad Answer

"So basically we needed to decompose the monolith because it wasn't scaling. I proposed using Kafka for event sourcing with saga patterns for distributed transactions. We'd containerize with Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes, using Istio for the service mesh. The data layer would use CQRS with eventually consistent read replicas. I documented all this in our Confluence with the technical specs. Some people didn't agree with the Kafka choice and wanted RabbitMQ, which was frustrating because Kafka is clearly better for our scale. We eventually just went with what I proposed since I had done the research. The documentation covers everything, though I do have to explain parts of it when new people join."
